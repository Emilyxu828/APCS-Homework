Scramble.java:
[I like this puzzle part a lot! :) ]
- You might want to make the pieces bigger and the highlighting thicker to make it easier to see (We talked about this already) 
- You should adjust the window size so everything fits on the school computers


Drawer.java:
*this part isn't finished yet
- (44) "foundslip" typo
- (69) "getContentPane" typo
- Just checking - The scissors will be in Drawer1 and the phone and slip won't?

I'm looking forward to play your project when it's finished!
